# Weather_Dashboard

For this homework assignment, I created a weather dashboard, which will allow a user (traveler) to search for the weather in multiple cities. The results are shown in a five day forecast format, which will show the city's weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The UV index will show whether the weather conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Their search results will be saved and will be displayed  even if the page is refreshed.
